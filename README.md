Hello, it is I, the idiot who tries to code, and fails miserably, FinnishDuck9. You may also call me Fin, Finn, or Duc/Duk.

Anywho, I am trying to make random projects because I'm bored, and learning how to code. If you wanna help, go right ahead.

Thanks for listening to my rambling. Now get lost, I'm coding, son.
